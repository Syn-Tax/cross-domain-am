Experiments using all labeled data of Librispeech achieve 1.8/3.3 WER on the clean/other test sets. When lowering the amount of labeled data to one hour, wav2vec 2.0 outperforms the previous state of the art on the 100 hour subset while using 100 times less labeled data. Using just ten minutes of labeled data and pre-training on 53k hours of unlabeled data still achieves 4.8/8.2 WER.

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

As speech signal contains multi-faceted information including speaker identity, paralinguistics, spoken content, etc., learning universal representations for all speech tasks is challenging. To tackle the problem, we propose a new pre-trained model, WavLM, to solve full-stack downstream speech tasks. WavLM jointly learns masked speech prediction and denoising in pre-training. By this means, WavLM does not only keep the speech content modeling capability by the masked speech prediction, but also improves the potential to non-ASR tasks by the speech denoising. In addition, WavLM employs gated relative position bias for the Transformer structure to better capture the sequence ordering of input speech. We also scale up the training dataset from 60 k hours to 94 k hours. WavLM Large achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SUPERB benchmark, and brings significant improvements for various speech processing tasks on their representative benchmarks.},

In the last years, significant progress has been made in understanding the theoretical properties of different argumentation logics. However, one major barrier to the development and practical deployment of argumentation systems is the lack of a shared, agreed notation or ``interchange format'' for argumentation and arguments. This article describes a draft specification for an Argument Interchange Format (AIF) intended for representation and exchange of data between various argumentation tools and agent-based applications. It represents a consensus `abstract model' established by researchers across fields of argumentation, artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems.1 In its current form, this specification is intended as a starting point for further discussion and elaboration by the community, rather than an attempt at a definitive, all encompassing model. However, to demonstrate proof of concept, a use case scenario is briefly described. Moreover, three concrete realisations or `reifications' of the abstract model are illustrated.},

In particular, numerous approaches have been proposed in the literature to predict the relations holding between the arguments, and application-specific annotated resources were built for this purpose. Despite the fact that these resources have been created to experiment on the same task, the definition of a single relation prediction method to be successfully applied to a significant portion of these datasets is an open research problem in Argument Mining. This means that none of the methods proposed in the literature can be easily ported from one resource to another. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a set of dataset independent strong neural baselines which obtain homogeneous results on all the datasets proposed in the literature for the argumentative relation prediction task. Thus, our baselines can be employed by the Argument Mining community to compare more effectively how well a method performs on the argumentative relation prediction task.},

The first approach is to predict what comes next in a sequence, which is a conventional language model in natural language processing. The second approach is to use a sequence autoencoder, which reads the input sequence into a vector and predicts the input sequence again. These two algorithms can be used as a "pretraining" step for a later supervised sequence learning algorithm. In other words, the parameters obtained from the unsupervised step can be used as a starting point for other supervised training models. In our experiments, we find that long short term memory recurrent networks after being pretrained with the two approaches are more stable and generalize better. With pretraining, we are able to train long short term memory recurrent networks up to a few hundred timesteps, thereby achieving strong performance in many text classification tasks, such as IMDB, DBpedia and 20 Newsgroups.},

  abstract = {Argumentation mining (AM) requires the identification of complex discourse structures and has lately been applied with success monolingually. In this work, we show that the existing resources are, however, not adequate for assessing cross-lingual AM, due to their heterogeneity or lack of complexity. We therefore create suitable parallel corpora by (human and machine) translating a popular AM dataset consisting of persuasive student essays into German, French, Spanish, and Chinese. We then compare (i) annotation projection and (ii) bilingual word embeddings based direct transfer strategies for cross-lingual AM, finding that the former performs considerably better and almost eliminates the loss from cross-lingual transfer. Moreover, we find that annotation projection works equally well when using either costly human or cheap machine translations. Our code and data are available at http://github.com/UKPLab/coling2018-xling\_argument\_mining.},

In contrast, less complex (local) tagging models based on BiLSTMs perform robustly across classification scenarios, being able to catch long-range dependencies inherent to the AM problem.

Different theories of argument, heterogeneous annotations, and a varied set of argumentation domains make it difficult to contextualise and understand the results reported in different work from a general perspective. In this paper, we present ARIES, a general benchmark for Argument Relation Identification aimed at providing with a standard evaluation for argument mining research. ARIES covers the three different language modelling approaches: sequence and token modelling, and sequence-to-sequence-to-sequence alignment, together with the three main Transformer-based model architectures: encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder. Furthermore, the benchmark consists of eight different argument mining datasets, covering the most common argumentation domains, and standardised with the same annotation structures. This paper provides a first comprehensive and comparative set of results in argument mining across a broad range of configurations to compare with, both advancing the state-of-the-art, and establishing a standard way to measure future advances in the area. Across varied task setups and architectures, our experiments reveal consistent challenges in cross-dataset evaluation, with notably poor results. Given the models' struggle to acquire transferable skills, the task remains challenging, opening avenues for future research.},

Thus they represent a natural application scenario for Argument Mining.

We address this task in an empirical manner by annotating 39 political debates from the last 50 years of US presidential campaigns, creating a new corpus of 29k argument components, labeled as premises and claims. We then propose two tasks: (1) identifying the argumentative components in such debates, and (2) classifying them as premises and claims. We show that feature-rich SVM learners and Neural Network architectures outperform standard baselines in Argument Mining over such complex data.

To deal with these three problems, we propose the Hidden-Unit BERT (HuBERT) approach for self-supervised speech representation learning, which utilizes an offline clustering step to provide aligned target labels for a BERT-like prediction loss. A key ingredient of our approach is applying the prediction loss over the masked regions only, which forces the model to learn a combined acoustic and language model over the continuous inputs. HuBERT relies primarily on the consistency of the unsupervised clustering step rather than the intrinsic quality of the assigned cluster labels. Starting with a simple k-means teacher of 100 clusters, and using two iterations of clustering, the HuBERT model either matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 performance on the Librispeech (960h) and Libri-light (60,000h) benchmarks with 10min, 1h, 10h, 100h, and 960h fine-tuning subsets. Using a 1B parameter model, HuBERT shows up to 19\% and 13\% relative WER reduction on the more challenging dev-other and test-other evaluation subsets.},

This paper proposed a solution to adjust imbalance dataset by combining Neighbor Cleaning Rule (NCL) and Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) techniques. The process of work is using NCL technique for removing sample data that are outliers in majority class and SMOTE technique is used for increasing sample data in minority class to closely balance dataset. After that, the balanced medical dataset is classified by Naive Bayes, SMO and KNN algorithm. The experimental results show that the recall rate can be improved from the models that were created from balanced dataset.},

  abstract = {With the rise and development of deep learning over the past decade, there has been a steady momentum of innovation and breakthroughs that convincingly push the state-of-the-art of cross-modal analytics between vision and language in multimedia field. Nevertheless, there has not been an open-source codebase in support of training and deploying numerous neural network models for cross-modal analytics in a unified and modular fashion. In this work, we propose X-modaler --- a versatile and high-performance codebase that encapsulates the state-of-the-art cross-modal analytics into several general-purpose stages (e.g., pre-processing, encoder, cross-modal interaction, decoder, and decode strategy). Each stage is empowered with the functionality that covers a series of modules widely adopted in state-of-the-arts and allows seamless switching in between. This way naturally enables a flexible implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms for image captioning, video captioning, and vision-language pre-training, aiming to facilitate the rapid development of research community. Meanwhile, since the effective modular designs in several stages (e.g., cross-modal interaction) are shared across different vision-language tasks, X-modaler can be simply extended to power startup prototypes for other tasks in cross-modal analytics, including visual question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, and cross-modal retrieval. X-modaler is an Apache-licensed codebase, and its source codes, sample projects and pre-trained models are available on-line: https://github.com/YehLi/xmodaler.},

While common implementations of these algorithms employ L\$\_2\$ regularization (often calling it "weight decay" in what may be misleading due to the inequivalence we expose), we propose a simple modification to recover the original formulation of weight decay regularization by {\textbackslash}emph\{decoupling\} the weight decay from the optimization steps taken w.r.t. the loss function. We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter). Our proposed decoupled weight decay has already been adopted by many researchers, and the community has implemented it in TensorFlow and PyTorch; the complete source code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/loshchil/AdamW-and-SGDW},

We take a previously reported dataset and present an audio-enhanced version (the Multimodal USElecDeb60To16 dataset). We report the performance of two text models based on BERT and GloVe embeddings, one audio model (based on CNN and Bi-LSTM) and multimodal combinations, on a dataset of 28,850 utterances. The results show that multimodal models do not outperform text-based models when using the full dataset. However, we show that audio features add value in fully supervised scenarios with limited data. We find that when data is scarce (e.g. with 10\% of the original dataset) multimodal models yield improved performance, whereas text models based on BERT considerably decrease performance. Finally, we conduct a study with artificially generated voices and an ablation study to investigate the importance of different audio features in the audio models.},

In this paper, we have experimented with the two resampling widely adopted techniques: oversampling and undersampling. In order to explore both techniques, we have chosen a public imbalanced dataset from kaggle website Santander Customer Transaction Prediction and have applied a group of well-known machine learning algorithms with different hyperparamters that give best results for both resampling techniques. One of the key findings of this paper is noticing that oversampling performs better than undersampling for different classifiers and obtains higher scores in different evaluation metrics.},

While studies on argument(ation) mining have proposed promising neural network models, they usually suffer from a shortage of training data. To address this issue, we expand the training data with various auxiliary argument mining corpora and propose an end-to-end cross-corpus training method called Multi-Task Argument Mining (MT-AM). To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments for the main argument mining tasks on several well-established argument mining corpora. The results demonstrate that MT-AM generally outperformed the models trained on a single corpus. Also, the smaller the target corpus was, the better the MT-AM performed. Our extensive analyses suggest that the improvement of MT-AM depends on several factors of transferability among auxiliary and target corpora.},

Then, we describe an implementation of this ontology using the RDF Schema Semantic Web-based ontology language, and demonstrate how our ontology enables the representation of networks of arguments on the Semantic Web. Finally, we present a pilot Semantic Web-based system, ArgDF, through which users can create arguments using different argumentation schemes and can query arguments using a Semantic Web query language. Manipulation of existing arguments is also handled in ArgDF: users can attack or support parts of existing arguments, or use existing parts of an argument in the creation of new arguments. ArgDF also enables users to create new argumentation schemes. As such, ArgDF is an open platform not only for representing arguments, but also for building interlinked and dynamic argument networks on the Semantic Web. This initial public-domain tool is intended to seed a variety of future applications for authoring, linking, navigating, searching, and evaluating arguments on the Web.},

  abstract = {Humans express their emotions via facial expressions, voice intonation and word choices. To infer the nature of the underlying emotion, recognition models may use a single modality, such as vision, audio, and text, or a combination of modalities. Generally, models that fuse complementary information from multiple modalities outperform their uni-modal counterparts. However, a successful model that fuses modalities requires components that can effectively aggregate task-relevant information from each modality. As cross-modal attention is seen as an effective mechanism for multi-modal fusion, in this paper we quantify the gain that such a mechanism brings compared to the corresponding self-attention mechanism. To this end, we implement and compare a cross-attention and a self-attention model. In addition to attention, each model uses convolutional layers for local feature extraction and recurrent layers for global sequential modelling. We compare the models using different modality combinations for a 7-class emotion classification task using the IEMOCAP dataset. Experimental results indicate that albeit both models improve upon the state-of-the-art in terms of weighted and unweighted accuracy for tri- and bi-modal configurations, their performance is generally statistically comparable.

  abstract = {Traditionally, argument mining research has approached the task of automatic identification of argument structures by using existing definitions of what constitutes an argument, while leaving the equally important matter of what does not qualify as an argument unaddressed. With the ability to distinguish between what is and what is not a natural language argument being at the core of argument mining as a field, it is interesting that no previous work has explored approaches to effectively select non-related propositions (i.e., propositions that are not connected through an argumentative relation, such as support or attack) that improve the data for learning argument mining tasks better. In this paper, we address the question of how to effectively sample non-related propositions from six different argument mining corpora belonging to different domains and encompassing both monologue and dialogue forms of argumentation. To that end, in addition to considering undersampling baselines from previous work, we propose three new sampling strategies relying on context (i.e., short/long) and the semantic similarity between propositions. Our results indicate that using more informed sampling strategies improves the performance, not only when evaluating models on their respective test splits, but also in the case of cross-domain evaluation.},

One of the main issues when approaching this problem is the lack of data, and the size of the publicly available corpora. In this work, we use the recently annotated US2016 debate corpus. US2016 is the largest existing argument annotated corpus, which allows exploring the benefits of the most recent advances in natural language processing in a complex domain like argument (relation) mining. We present an exhaustive analysis of the behavior of transformer-based models (i.e., BERT, XLNET, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and ALBERT) when predicting argument relations. Finally, we evaluate the models in five different domains, with the objective of finding the less domain-dependent model. We obtain a macro F1-score of 0.70 with the US2016 evaluation corpus, and a macro F1-score of 0.61 with the Moral Maze cross-domain corpus.},

However, humans are proved to behave differently, mixing rational and emotional attitudes to guide their actions, and it has been claimed that there exists a strong connection between the argumentation process and the emotions felt by people involved in such process. In this paper, we assess this claim by means of an experiment: during several debates people's argumentation in plain English is connected and compared to the emotions automatically detected from the participants. Our results show a correspondence between emotions and argumentation elements, e.g., when in the argumentation two opposite opinions are conflicting this is reflected in a negative way on the debaters' emotions.},

In spite of early detection being crucial to improving prognosis, this mental illness remains largely undiagnosed. Depression classification from voice holds the promise to revolutionize diagnosis by ubiquitously integrating this screening capability into virtual assistants and smartphone technologies. Unfortunately, due to privacy concerns, audio datasets with depression labels have a small number of participants, causing current classification models to suffer from low performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Audio-Assisted BERT (AudiBERT), a novel deep learning framework that leverages the multimodal nature of human voice. To alleviate the small data problem, AudiBERT integrates pretrained audio and text representation models for the respective modalities augmented by a dual self-attention mechanism into a deep learning architecture. AudiBERT applied to depression classification consistently achieves promising performance with an increase in F1 scores between 6\% and 30\% compared to state-of-the-art audio and text models for 15 thematic question datasets. Using answers from medically targeted and general wellness questions, our framework achieves F1 scores of up to 0.92 and 0.86, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of depression screening from informal dialogue using voice-enabled technologies.},

However, two major challenges in modeling such multimodal human language time-series data exist: 1) inherent data non-alignment due to variable sampling rates for the sequences from each modality; and 2) long-range dependencies between elements across modalities. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Transformer (MulT) to generically address the above issues in an end-to-end manner without explicitly aligning the data. At the heart of our model is the directional pairwise crossmodal attention, which attends to interactions between multimodal sequences across distinct time steps and latently adapt streams from one modality to another. Comprehensive experiments on both aligned and non-aligned multimodal time-series show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. In addition, empirical analysis suggests that correlated crossmodal signals are able to be captured by the proposed crossmodal attention mechanism in MulT.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

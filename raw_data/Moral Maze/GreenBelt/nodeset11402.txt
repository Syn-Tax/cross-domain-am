Michael Buerk:	Can we make this a doubles match as well as a singles match?
	George, it's quite interesting with our next witness, Toby Lloyd, where ... or maybe I wasn't following it closely enough, but it's quite interesting with this argument about how much it is to do with the individuals' rights and responsibilities versus the communities', and which way round that argument was. Where do you think the locus of that argument lies?
George Buskell:	I think that the people that are in need of the homes are the community, and that ultimately they are being stopped by the individuals that perpetuate this. Sort of like an attitude towards homes where they're like an investment, rather than a place to live.
Michael Buerk:	So when the Faversham Heritage Society, if there is such a thing, objects to development plans, they're just a collection of atomised individuals, are they? With less moral force.
George Buskell:	I guess they've become sort of like a sort of a difference between the collective good and what the community wants. I think there definitely is a difference, people aren't infallible. 
Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	Could I just jump in there by [crosstalk 00:41:08] saying that, I mean, if you want to look at a collective, look at the popularity of the green belt policy.
George Buskell:	Go for it.
Michael Buerk:	Yeah, Maddie.
Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	If you want to look at us as a nation coming together over what we believe in and what we think has moral value, I think you'll find we like the countryside.
George Buskell:	But that doesn't make it the collective good.
Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	Good point, but I still think you're a little bit outnumbered.
Michael Buerk:	We never say "good point" on the Moral Maze.
Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	I take it back!
Michael Buerk:	Never give an inch!

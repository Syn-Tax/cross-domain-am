Michael Buerk:	George ... just going back to what Howard Davies was saying as our last witness. He was saying that even going along with the human utility argument, which you've espoused, it is rather important to us for utilitarian reasons.
George Buskell:	Yeah.
Michael Buerk:	If we develop on floodplains, we get a lot of flooding, our health is essentially - probably our physical and our mental health - are banned up in an environment which we enjoy and doesn't threaten us.
George Buskell:	I definitely argue that nature has utility, but as someone previously pointed out, the green belt isn't necessarily nature. And a lot of the green belt, although you can say "Oh, it's very nice. We can go out to this park, we can all go out and have some fun". Well, not everyone can, and a lot of it is actually used for ridiculous things, like private golf courses. Well who benefits from that? The people who can afford to play golf. It's not all valuable, in that sense.
Michael Buerk:	I must add golf club members to the list of well-heeled, affluent, and old people who have ...
	Jane, come on. Last word, with you.
Jane Fidge:	I think it was a very important point to make, that actually we need nature. We can't just brush it off as a few trees that we're getting rid of. Fundamentally, humans need nature to survive. We can't just sort of say "We need houses, so let's build it ... nature's gone, we won't be able to breathe, but it's fine". The fact that you're trying to boil it down to such a binary social and sort of the natural world ... you can't, because it's such a blurred line between the two, and it's so interconnected. You cannot really separate them. And I think if you try to do that, then it becomes quite a dangerous argument. I think you really have to think about the implications that both have on each other.
